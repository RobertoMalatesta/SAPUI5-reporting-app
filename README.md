SAPUI5-reporting-app
====================

SAPUI5 reporting app using controls from the SAPUI5 custom controls repository.

Create a new SAPUI5 application, then add this code to it in the web content.

Based on a split app, where reports are to the left side, and clicking one opens report views. Shows off custom chart controls, as well as how you need to deal with updates (especially in the GrowthRegions view, where we use the selected index to show the right charts).

--------------------
Note: i18n is supplied, but not actually used in the app. Remnant of some demo kit code...
